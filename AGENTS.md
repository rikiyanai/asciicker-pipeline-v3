# Agent Entry Point
Follow this repository rule before doing any task.

## Conductor Guardrail
Always run `conductor:status` first.

- Command alias: `conductor_status`
- Direct command: `python3 scripts/conductor_tools.py status --auto-setup`
- Behavior: if Conductor is missing, status runs setup and creates the baseline.

## Cross-Repo Vendored Content

`docs/research/ascii/semantic_maps/` is a **symlink** to `asciicker-Y9-2/docs/research/ascii/semantic_maps/`.
Y9-2 is the source of truth for semantic map JSON files and anchor data.
Pipeline-v3 vendors them so the validator (`scripts/validate_semantic_maps.py`) can run locally.

- Do NOT create or edit semantic map files in pipeline-v3 directly — edit in Y9-2.
- The symlink uses a relative path (`../../../../asciicker-Y9-2/...`) assuming both repos are siblings.
- If the symlink is broken, re-create: `ln -sfn ../../../../asciicker-Y9-2/docs/research/ascii/semantic_maps docs/research/ascii/semantic_maps`
