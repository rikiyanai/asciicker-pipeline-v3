"""FL-4162 step 8 — reviewed source-layer decision capture (write path).

A THIRD owner, deliberately separate from the two that precede it:

  1. state_FINAL_*.json        immutable hand-corpus      (authored, sha-pinned)
  2. layer_evidence_cards.jsonl source-backed evidence    (authority:false)
  3. source_layer_review_decisions.jsonl  <-- THIS FILE   reviewed human verdict

This module owns ONLY #3. It writes a human's reviewed decision about a single
(source_xp_path + raw_layer_index) layer, captured while looking at that layer's
evidence card through the XP Body Viewer microscope.

AUTHORITY DISCIPLINE (do not regress):
  - A decision is a PROPOSAL, never semantic-map authority. Every record carries
    `authority: false`. No compiler / ActorVisualProfile path consumes this file
    yet — that is step 10, behind its own fail-closed gate.
  - Fail closed (canon Law 6): a decision pins `source_card_fingerprint`, the hash
    of the evidence card it was made against. If the card the reviewer is looking
    at no longer matches the fingerprint they began the decision with, the write
    is BLOCKED — a stale decision must never silently apply to changed evidence.
  - This module never mutates state_FINAL or the evidence cards. It only appends
    reviewed verdicts to its own file, atomically (temp + os.replace), upserting
    by source_key so the current verdict per layer reloads beside its card.

The interactive trigger (a viewer keybind + typed prompt) lives in
xp_uv_body_viewer.py. The write/read/fingerprint logic lives here so it is pure
and unit-testable without a TTY.
