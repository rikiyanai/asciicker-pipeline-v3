"""FL-4162 — agent manual review of the existing hand corpus -> proposal surface.

This is NOT relabeling. The human judgment already exists in the state_FINAL hand
corpus (status / corrected_label / note / pre_source / pre_guess), preserved card
by card in layer_evidence_cards.jsonl. This tool performs *agent manual review* of
that corpus: for each reviewed card it reads the hand label together with the glyph
exact/near evidence and the engine composition facts, and turns the hand verdict
into a deliberate, structured PROPOSAL — while marking contradictions and
unresolved topology instead of forcing a clean role.

Output is two artifacts, both proposal-only (authority:false):

  1. manual_candidate_review.json        readable review packet (ALL reviewed cards
                                          + every preserved evidence field + the
                                          agent verdict + a pending-by-class index)
  2. source_layer_review_decisions.jsonl  only the SUPPORTED reviewed rows, written
                                          through decision_capture (authority:false,
                                          fingerprint-pinned, fail-closed loader)

Discipline (do not regress):
  - The proposal's authority is the HAND LABEL, never glyph co-occurrence. Role
    tokens are read from the human's own words; they are never inferred from a
    glyph pattern (that is the classifier trap this lane exists to avoid).
  - A card is written to the decisions file ONLY when supported=True and
    unresolved=False. Uncertain hand prose ("maybe", "idk", "?") stays in the
    packet as unresolved and is NOT promoted to a decision.
  - Nothing here mutates state_FINAL or the evidence cards, and nothing claims
    compiler / semantic-map authority. That gate is later (Step 10).

Coverage: the full 343-card corpus is reviewed, rejects-first, by queue class:
  - wrong_guess_reject  card-keyed agent verdicts (REVIEWED)
  - reject / partial / prose_caps_accept  interpreted label clusters (CLUSTER_BATCHES)
  - clean_accept        passthrough — the hand label is already a role token
  - ambig               fail-closed UNRESOLVED by class policy (never auto-proposed)
Any card a handler does not cover is reported as pending/uncovered in the packet, so
coverage is never silently overclaimed.
